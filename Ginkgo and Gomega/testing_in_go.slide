* Testing in Go

Go Test:
- Provides basic tests to your code
- Has a test coverage tool
- A lot(!) of "if"s and repetitions
- No setups and teardowns (before/after)
- Test files end with "_test.go"
- Import “testing” in test file
- Add functions such as "func TestX(*testing.T)"

* Let's use BDD!

- Behavior Driven Development
- In BDD, the development is guided and measured against a predefined set of desirable functionality
- Ginkgo - BDD style testing framework for Go
- Gomega - matching library (assertions) for Go

* Let's dive in

- `Describe` and `Context` blocks - organize scenarios
- `BeforeEach` blocks - same setup code for tests
- `It` blocks - "It should do...", code behaviour
- `Expect` - the assertions of Gomega: expect something...
- Plenty of ways to assert, so much power!

* Let it rip

- You can just use `go test`
- Or use `ginkgo`
- You can add tags such as `-r`, `-p` etc.
